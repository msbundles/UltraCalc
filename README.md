# UltraCalc
This repository contains two programs, UltraCalc written in C++
 and UltraCalc written in Python. The C++ version will continue to be improved and added on to and will most likely be the main focus of this repository. The program is a four function calculator with other assorted features. I do not have build instructions for Windows. I have also never tested UltraCalc on Windows mainly because I am not familiar with Windows C++ development. The Python version is hosted [here](https://msbundles.github.io/UltraCalc/).
